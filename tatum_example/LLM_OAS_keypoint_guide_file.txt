Account-A Tatum Account is the primary building block of Tatumpowered applications It is an envelope that holds essential information about balances the state of the account or customer and to whom the account belongs
Accounts in Tatum are stored within Tatum Private Ledger Tatum Private Ledger contains information about accounts the customers that own the accounts transactions that affect the accounts or virtual currencies present in the ledger
By default the private ledger is not connected to any blockchain It is possible to create an application on it without any blockchain at all Using Tatum Private Ledger and the building blocks included within it it is possible to quickly swap the whole application from the ledger to any blockchain supported by Tatum All of the API calls will remain the same the only thing that changes is the blockchain the application lives on
Most blockchains do not have any compliance layer at all It is not possible to freeze funds at a blockchain address or deactivate an address The Tatum Account has builtin compliance and it is possible to block funds in the account freeze outgoing transactions from the account or even completely deactivate the account

Transaction-An endpoint used to create and list transactions within Tatum Private Ledger A transaction is performed between 2 accounts with the same currency To perform an exchange operation between accounts with different currencies API calls from Order Book sections are available Transactions in the ledger are instant with a settlement time of below 200ms
Tatum Private Ledger supports microtransactions  a transaction of an amount as little as 1e30 30 decimal places Transactions are atomic
When there is an insufficient balance in the sender account or recipient account cannot receive funds the transaction is not settled

Ethereum-Ethereum is a decentralized opensource blockchain With Tatum you can access the most commonly used Ethereum methods These methods bring a certain level of abstraction and are used for applications that communicate with the blockchain directly Some of the methods are used alongside virtual accounts to connect the blockchain and a virtual account like generating a wallet or getting information about transactions
Tatum supports the following Ethereum networks

Mainnet the primary public production blockchain
Sepolia a proofofwork testnet and the default testnet for Ethereum The testnet cryptocurrency has no value and you can obtain it from a faucet for example FaucETH

Key Management System-Key Management System KMS is a comprehensive solution for building custodial applications KMS runs locally on your server and provides security for generating wallets addresses and private keys and for signing transactions
KMS builds a list of pending transaction to sign and provides the options to complete a transaction after it has been signed and to obtain transaction details with the result of the blockchain operation via the transaction ID
In KMS each managed wallet or private key is assigned a unique signature ID signatureId that represents that wallet or private key This signature ID is then used in an API request to identify the wallet
Depending on the API you can use the signature ID in an API call request in the following ways


To represent the mnemonic type of the wallet for example in the API for sending BTC from a virtual account to the blockchain see the transferBtcKMS request schema
To represent the privateKey type of the wallet for example in the API for sending BTC to a blockchain address see the BtcTransactionFromUTXOKMS request schema
To represent the mnemonic and index type of the wallet for example in the API for sending ETH from a virtual account to the blockchain see the transferEthKMS request schemaIn this case the index of the specific private key generated from the mnemonic must be used in addition to the signature ID

You can run KMS on the following operating systems

macOS Natively or via Docker
Unix Natively or via Docker
MS Windows Only via Docker

For more information about KMS see the KMS GitHub repository and the user documentation

XRP-XRPL is a decentralized public blockchain With Tatum you can access the most commonly used XRPL methods These methods bring a certain level of abstraction and are used for applications that communicate with the blockchain directly Some of the methods are used alongside virtual accounts to connect the blockchain and a virtual account like generating a wallet or getting information about transactions
Tatum supports the following XRPL networks

Mainnet the primary public production blockchain
Testnet a mainnetlike network for testing applications on XRPL The testnet cryptocurrency has no value and you can obtain it from a faucet for example XRP Faucets

To start using the XRPL blockchain create an XRPL account On XRPL the same account is used for the mainnet and the testnet To activate the account credit it with 20 XRP
Because of the activation requirement it is common to use one account for all customers and differentiate them via Destination tags A Destination tag is a number included in every transaction as an account distinguisher
When an offchain deposit address is created for a virtual account a Destination tag is generated for that account for example 12345 When you make a transaction to the blockchain be sure to include the address of the recipient and the Destination tag as an account distinguisher Examples of working with the XRP blockchain can be found in Tatum XRP SDK

In order to start using the XLM blockchain we first need to create an XLM account In order to have the account activated it must be credited with 05 XLM  Because of this requirement it is common to use one account for all customers and differentiate them using a memo  a short text/number included in every transaction as an account distinguisher
When an offchain deposit address is created for the ledger account a memo is generated eg 12345 for that account When a transaction to the blockchain is performed it should contain the address of the recipient and the memo as an account distinguisher
